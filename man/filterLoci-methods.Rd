\title{Filter loci}
\usage{
filterLoci(counts, filter = n_called > n_missing)

\S4method{filterLoci}{GRangesList}(counts, filter = n_called > n_missing)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{\code{GRangesList} containing a summary of allele counts at each
range.
Each element of the list represents a distinct sample group.}

\item{filter}{A logical expression indicating which rows to keep.
Possible values include:
\itemize{
\item \code{n_called}
The number of total alleles called.
\item \code{n_missing}
The number of total alleles not reported.
\item \code{n_0}, \code{n_1}, \code{n_2}, \code{n_3}
The number of ref, alt1, alt2 and alt3 alleles respectively.
}

All values represent the sum of counts across all samples within the group.
Defaults to return loci where the number of samples containing allele
information is greater than number samples with missing information.}
}
\value{
\code{GRangesList} containing a summary of allele counts at each range
passing the filter criteria.
Each element of the list represents a distinct sample group.
}
\description{
Filter loci based on allele count criteria.
