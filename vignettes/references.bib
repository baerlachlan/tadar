  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        In comparisons between mutant and wild-type genotypes, transcriptome analysis can reveal the direct impacts of a mutation, together with the homeostatic responses of the biological system. Recent studies have highlighted that, when homozygous mutations are studied in non-isogenic backgrounds, genes from the same chromosome as a mutation often appear over-represented among differentially expressed (DE) genes. One hypothesis suggests that DE genes chromosomally linked to a mutation may not reflect true biological responses to the mutation but, instead, result from differences in representation of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) between sample groups selected on the basis of mutant or wild-type genotype. This is problematic when inclusion of spurious DE genes in a functional enrichment study results in incorrect inferences of mutation effect. Here we show that             chromosomally co-located differentially expressed genes             (CC-DEGs) can also be observed in analyses of dominant mutations in heterozygotes. We define a method and a metric to quantify, in RNA-sequencing data, localised differential allelic representation (DAR) between groups of samples subject to differential expression analysis. We show how the DAR metric can predict regions prone to eQTL-driven differential expression, and how it can improve functional enrichment analyses through gene exclusion or weighting of gene-level rankings. Advantageously, this improved ability to identify probable eQTLs also reveals examples of CC-DEGs that             are             likely to be functionally related to a mutant phenotype. This supports a long-standing prediction that selection for advantageous linkage disequilibrium influences chromosome evolution. By comparing the genomes of zebrafish (             Danio rerio             ) and medaka (             Oryzias latipes             ), a teleost with a conserved ancestral karyotype, we find possible examples of chromosomal aggregation of CC-DEGs during evolution of the zebrafish lineage. The DAR metric provides a solid foundation for addressing the eQTL issue in new and existing datasets because it relies solely on RNA-sequencing data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org) is unique in its flexible infrastructure for access to genomic data and annotation. It has been designed to efficiently deliver annotation at scale for all eukaryotic life, and it also provides deep comprehensive annotation for key species. Genomes representing a greater diversity of species are increasingly being sequenced. In response, we have focussed our recent efforts on expediting the annotation of new assemblies. Here, we report the release of the greatest annual number of newly annotated genomes in the history of Ensembl via our dedicated Ensembl Rapid Release platform (http://rapid.ensembl.org). We have also developed a new method to generate comparative analyses at scale for these assemblies and, for the first time, we have annotated non-vertebrate eukaryotes. Meanwhile, we continually improve, extend and update the annotation for our high-value reference vertebrate genomes and report the details here. We have a range of specific software tools for specific tasks, such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and the newly developed interface for the Variant Recoder. All Ensembl data, software and tools are freely available for download and are accessible programmatically.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Sanfilippo syndrome childhood dementia, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder. Subtypes of MPS III are caused by deficiencies in one of four enzymes required for degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS). An inability to degrade HS leads to progressive neurodegeneration and death in the second or third decades of life. Knowledge of MPS III pathogenesis is incomplete, and no effective therapies exist. We generated the hypomorphic mutations                            sgsh               S387Lfs                          ,                            naglu               A603Efs                          and                            hgsnat               G577Sfs                          in the endogenous zebrafish genes orthologous to human             SGSH             ,             NAGLU             , and             HGSNAT             that are loci for mutations causing MPS III subtypes MPS IIIA, B and C respectively. Our models display the primary MPS III disease signature of significant brain accumulation of HS, while behavioural analyses support hyperactivity phenotypes. Brain transcriptome analysis revealed changes related to lysosomal, glycosaminoglycan, immune system and iron homeostasis biology in all three models but also distinct differences in brain transcriptome state between models. The transcriptome analysis also indicated marked disturbance of the oligodendrocyte cell state in the brains of MPS IIIA, B and C zebrafish, supporting that effects on this cell type are an early and consistent characteristic of MPS III. Overall, our zebrafish models recapture key characteristics of the human disease and phenotypes seen in mouse models. Our models will allow exploitation of the zebrafish's extreme fecundity and accessible anatomy to dissect the pathological mechanisms both common and divergent between the MPS IIIA, B, and C subtypes.},

  abstract = {In model organisms, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is frequently used to assess the effect of genetic mutations on cellular and developmental processes. Typically, animals heterozygous for a mutation are crossed to produce offspring with different genotypes. Resultant embryos are grouped by genotype to compare homozygous mutant embryos to heterozygous and wild-type siblings. Genes that are differentially expressed between the groups are assumed to reveal insights into the pathways affected by the mutation. Here we show that in zebrafish, differentially expressed genes are often over-represented on the same chromosome as the mutation due to different levels of expression of alleles from different genetic backgrounds. Using an incross of haplotype-resolved wild-type fish, we found evidence of widespread allele-specific expression, which appears as differential expression when comparing embryos homozygous for a region of the genome to their siblings. When analysing mutant transcriptomes, this means that the differential expression of genes on the same chromosome as a mutation of interest may not be caused by that mutation. Typically, the genomic location of a differentially expressed gene is not considered when interpreting its importance with respect to the phenotype. This could lead to pathways being erroneously implicated or overlooked due to the noise of spurious differentially expressed genes on the same chromosome as the mutation. These observations have implications for the interpretation of RNA-seq experiments involving outbred animals and non-inbred model organisms.},
