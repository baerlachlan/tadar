Package: tadar
Title: Differential Allelic Representation
Version: 0.99.0
Description: This package provides functions to standardise the analysis of
    Differential Allelic Representation (DAR). DAR analysis is intended to
    be performed on genotype calls from variant discovery software, resulting
    in a metric that represents the allelic diversity between groups of samples
    at each SNP locus. The DAR metric provides a good estimate for the
    possibility of expression quantitative trait loci differences between
    sample groups, which may contribute to unexpected variability gene
    expression and influence to results of Differential Expression analysis.
